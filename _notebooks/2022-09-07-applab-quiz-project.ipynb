    "JavaScript functions have special properties and syntax is shown in many ways.  In fact, a Class in JavaScript is a special function.  Jupyter Notebooks seems to be more friendly to \"function\" definitions versus \"Class\", thus this lesson uses \"function\" and \"prototype\" versus \"Class\".\n",
    "- <mark>Definition of function allows for a collection of data</mark>, the \"function Person\" allows programmer to retain name, github id, and class of designation.\n",
    "- <mark>Definition of a prototype allow for the definition of a method associated with the function</mark> , the \"Person.prototype.toJSON\" allows the collection of data to be expressed in a json/string versus JavaScript object.\n",
    "- <mark>Instance of a function</mark>, the \"var teacher = new Person(\"Mr M\", \"jm1021\", 1977)\" line makes a variable \"teacher\" which is an object representation of \"function Person\"."
