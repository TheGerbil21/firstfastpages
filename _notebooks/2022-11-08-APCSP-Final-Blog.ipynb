    "I got this question wrong because I incorrectly assumed that the code segment used a double multiplication algorithm. In reality the repeat function combined with the multiplication statement means that an exponent should be used in the formula. 2 (5 * 5 * 5) = 2 (5^3)\n",

    "I got this question wrong because I incorrectly chose C as one of the options, which assigns maxPS the value 50 when time > 120 and assigns maxPS the value 30 otherwise. This does not set the maxPS based on time. The A option has the correct code segment that sets maxPS to 50, then uses the IF statement to set maxPS to 30 when time > 120."

Studying the question again, I now understand that in the most basic form of binary, Binary 0011 is equivalent to 2^1+2^0, or decimal 3. Binary 0110 is equivalent to 2^2+2^1, or decimal 6. Binary 1111 is equivalent to 2^3+2^2+2^1+2^0, or decimal 15. This is why Decimal 9 is the correct answer.\n",

Since num2 â‰¥ num3 evaluates to true, the body of the second IF block is executed and num1 is assigned the value 8. Lastly, sum is assigned the value of 8 + 4 + 4, or 16.\n",

I realized that before addition is preformed, the code segment first iterates through each element in the list, incrementing count1 for each positive value and incrementing count2 otherwise. The list only contains two positive values, so count1 is 2 and count2 is 3."
