    "I did way better than I expected and compared to the previous College Board Multiple Choice Quizzes, I understood much more material and it took me much less time. A lot of the questions, I realized, were topics covered in the weeks prior where we learned about other Big Ideas, learned about certain topics and had group/class discussions."

    "\n",
    "Overall, I think I did great on this multiple choice quiz. Last time, it took me a lot of more time to digest what the questions were asking and then understand how I could even decide the answer. I understood the majority of the topics on this quiz almost after a minute or two with multiple reads. From the last multiple choice, I feel like I have actually learned a lot more, even if it is the most basic knowledge. Before this quiz I was really discouraged about my progress and felt like I have not really learned much or made any progress, but from my results and the way I got through this quiz, I think I am on track so far in APCSP."
