# About Me: How I view focus, vocabulary, and capturing learnings. 

In Computer Science, you are almost guaranteed to run into bugs, issues, and problems. While it's possible to solve all of these on your own, a much better way of tackling AP CSP difficulties is through **Collaboration, Communication, Critical Thinking, and Creativity**. Most importantly, viewing mistakes as learning opportunities and asking questions improves the learning experience for everyone.

When talking about focus, I think it's important to recognize that Computer Science is very intertwined. We need to look at the bigger picture of what we are doing instead of the actual code itself. With the help of stand-up meetings, issue tickets, and live reviews, there are many opportunities for others to comment on our work and to stay accountable.
