<h2 id="Ideation-and-Planning">Ideation and Planning<a class="anchor-link" href="#Ideation-and-Planning"> </a></h2><p>To build a functional and interactive quiz, I needed a good topic and questions. I decided on a topic of <mark>Mountains and Mountain Ranges</mark> and wrote the following three questions with answer choices:</p>
<p>What is the tallest mountain in the World? 
Answer Choices: <mark>Mt. Everest</mark>, Mt. K2, Mt. Fiji, Mt. Kilimanjaro.</p>
<p>How many main mountain ranges exist in America? 
Answer Choices: One, Two, <mark>Three</mark>, Four</p>
<p>What is the World Record altitude for a human mountaineer? 
Answer Choices: <mark>29,029 Feet</mark>, 26,545 Feet, 28,750 Feet, 24,075 Feet</p>
<p>I then got to designing the actual quiz on AppLab. Here's an image of my initial Javascript code, where I used the most basic functions:</p>

<h2 id="Successes-and-Failures">Successes and Failures<a class="anchor-link" href="#Successes-and-Failures"> </a></h2><p>The whole process went relatively smoothly, with the code and design segments being very straightforward to use. I like the Code.org software and how I can seamlessly switch between blocks and actual code to learn Javascript better.</p>
<p>Some setbacks did happen during the process, I initially had some difficulty finding the right code to make up the quiz functions, but eventually I found my solutions with the <mark>"switch screen"</mark> function. Time management was also an issue, but I managed to finish the quiz and planning by the due date.</p>
