<li>purpose of computing innovations: to solve problems or pursue interests thru creative expression</li>
<li>an understanding of the purpose of a computing innovation provides developers with an improved ability to develop innovation</li>
<li>Guiding questions:<ul>
<li>why does the computing innovation exist?</li>
<li>what problems does the computing innovation solve?</li>
<li>what does the computing innovation allow us to do that we could not do before?</li>
</ul>

<li>program inputs are data sent to a computer for processing by a program. input forms: tactile, audio, visual, or text</li>
<li>an event is associated with an action and supplies input data to a program</li>
<li>events can be generated when a key is pressed, a mouse is clicked, a program is started, or any other defined action occurs that affects the flow of execution</li>
<li>inputs usually affect the output produced by a program</li>
<li>in event-driven programming, program statements are executed when triggered rather than through the sequential flow of control
input can come from a user or other programs</li>
<li><p>program outputs are any data sent from a program to a device. program output can come in a variety of forms, such as tactile, audio, visual, or text</p>
</li>
<li><p>input:</p>
<ul>
<li>tactile (touch)</li>
<li>audio</li>
<li>visual</li>
<li>text (including numerical values)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>what does input accomplish:<ul>
<li>affects the output. what outputs are produced by a device?</li>
<li>visual</li>
<li>audio</li>
<li>tactile (touch/feel)</li>
<li>text</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>an action triggers an event:<ul>
<li>action may be initiated by the user or other program/device</li>
<li>program jumps to code segment according to event<ul>
<li>code is executed</li>
<li>output or additional events are triggered</li>
<li>executed as called</li>

<li>A program is a collection of program statements that performs a specific task when run by a computer. a program is often referred to as software.</li>
<li>a code segment is a collection of program statements that is part of a program</li>
<li>a program needs to work for a variety of inputs and situations</li>
<li>the behavior of a program is how a program functions during execution and is often described by how a user interacts with it</li>
<li>a program can be described broadly by what it does, or in more detail by both what the program does and how the program statements accomplish this function</li>
<li>a program: a collection of statements<ul>
<li>statement: a single command</li>
<li>code segment: group of statements<ul>
<li>executed according to the rules ofo the programming language</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>a program = software</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>how to describe a code segment:<ul>
<li>state what is does, simply<ul>
<li>so that someone could use the code segment in a larger program</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>or include how it does what it does:<ul>
<li>explain how the code segment functions</li>
<li>so that someone can expand upon the code segment</li>
