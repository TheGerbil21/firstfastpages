            "content": "Lists . What are lists? . Lists: a sequence of variables . we can use lists to store multiple items into one variable | used to store collections of data | changeable, ordered, allow duplicates | . List examples in Python, JavaScript, and Pseudocode. . fruits = [&quot;apple&quot;, &quot;grape&quot;, &quot;strawberry&quot;] print (fruits) . [&#39;apple&#39;, &#39;grape&#39;, &#39;strawberry&#39;] . const fruits = [&quot;apple&quot;, &quot;grape&quot;, &quot;strawberry&quot;]; . fruits ← [apple, grape, strawberry] . More list examples . brands = [&quot;nike&quot;, &quot;adidas&quot;, &quot;underarmour&quot;] #string numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] #integer truefalse = [True, False, True] #boolean . Lists are just one of four collection data types in Python . Tuple: collection that is ordered, unchangeable, allows duplicates | Set: collection that is unordered, unchangeable, doesn&#39;t allow duplicates | Dictionary: collection that is ordered, changeable, doesn&#39;t allow duplicates | . Terms . Index: a term used to sort data in order to reference to an element in a list (allows for duplicates) | Elements: the values in the list assigned to an index | . fruits = [&quot;apple&quot;, &quot;grape&quot;, &quot;strawberry&quot;] index = 1 print (fruits[index]) . grape . Methods in Lists . Method Definition Example . append() | adds element to the end of the list | fruits.append(&quot;watermelon&quot;) | . index() | returns the index of the first element with the specified value | fruits.index(&quot;apple&quot;) | . insert() | adds element at given position | fruits.insert(1, &quot;watermelon&quot;) | . remove() | removes the first item with the specified value | fruits.remove(&quot;strawberry&quot;) | . reverse() | reverses the list order | fruits.reverse() | . sort() | sorts the list | fruits.sort() | . count() | returns the amount of elements with the specified value | fruits.count(&quot;apple&quot;) | . copy() | returns a copy of the list | fruits.copy() | . clear() | removes the elements from the list | fruits.clear() | . sports = [&quot;football&quot;, &quot;hockey&quot;, &quot;baseball&quot;, &quot;basketball&quot;] # change the value &quot;soccer&quot; to &quot;hockey&quot; print (sports) .

Coding all of these individually takes a lot of unnecessary time, how can we shorten this time? . Iteration . Iteration is the repetition of a process or utterance applied to the result or taken from a previous statement. There&#39;s a lot of types of iteration though, what to use? How do we apply iteration to lists? . Some methods include using a &quot;for loop&quot;, using a &quot;for loop and range()&quot;, using a &quot;while loop&quot;, and using comprehension . Lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets are iterable objects. They are the &#39;containers&#39; that store the data to iterate. . Each of these containers are able to iterate with the iter() command. . There are 2 types of iteration:definite and indefinite. Definite iteration clarifies how many times the loop is going to run, while indefinite specifies a condition that must be met . for variable in iterable: statement() . Iterator? Iterable? Iteration? . When an object is iterable it can be used in an iteration | When passed through the function iter() it returns an iterator | Strings, lists, dictionaries, sets and tuples are all examples of iterable objects. | . a = [&#39;alpha&#39;, &#39;bravo&#39;, &#39;charlie&#39;] itr = iter(a) print(next(itr)) print(next(itr)) print(next(itr)) . alpha bravo charlie . Loops . Well, above is basically just printing them again, so how do we takes these iterators into something we can make use for? | Loops take essentially what we did above and automates it, here are some examples. | . list = [&quot;Alpha&quot;, &quot;Bravo&quot;, &quot;Charlie&quot;, &quot;Delta&quot;, &quot;Echo&quot;, &quot;Foxtrot&quot;, &quot;Golf&quot;, &quot;Hotel&quot;, &quot;India&quot;, &quot;Juliett&quot;, &quot;Kilo&quot;, &quot;Lima&quot;, &quot;Mike&quot;, &quot;November&quot;, &quot;Oscar&quot;, &quot;Papa&quot;, &quot;Quebec&quot;, &quot;Romeo&quot;, &quot;Sierra&quot;, &quot;Tango&quot;, &quot;Uniform&quot;, &quot;Victor&quot;, &quot;Whiskey&quot;, &quot;X-ray&quot;, &quot;Yankee&quot;, &quot;Zulu&quot;] # using a for loop for i in list: #for item in the list, print the item print(i) .

Alpha Bravo Charlie Delta Echo Foxtrot Golf Hotel India Juliett Kilo Lima Mike November Oscar Papa Quebec Romeo Sierra Tango Uniform Victor Whiskey X-ray Yankee Zulu . Using the range() function . But wait, there&#39;s more . Need to save even more time? The above is useful for many occasions, but can get tedious fast, in this case, use range() | . x = range(5) for n in x: print(n) . 0 1 2 3 4 . Else, elif, and break . For when 1 statement isn&#39;t enough . Else:when the condition does not meet, do statement()- Elif: when the condition does not meet, but meets another condition, do statement() | Break: stop the loop | . HW Iteration . Use the list below to turn the first letter of any word (using input()) into its respective NATO phonetic alphabet word . Ex: list -&gt; lima india sierra tango . words = [&quot;alfa&quot;, &quot;bravo&quot;, &quot;charlie&quot;, &quot;delta&quot;, &quot;echo&quot;, &quot;foxtrot&quot;, &quot;golf&quot;, &quot;hotel&quot;, &quot;india&quot;, &quot;juliet&quot;, &quot;kilo&quot;, &quot;lima&quot;, &quot;mike&quot;, &quot;november&quot;, &quot;oscar&quot;, &quot;papa&quot;, &quot;quebec&quot;, &quot;romeo&quot;, &quot;sierra&quot;, &quot;tango&quot;, &quot;uniform&quot;, &quot;victor&quot;, &quot;whiskey&quot;, &quot;xray&quot;, &quot;yankee&quot;, &quot;zulu&quot;] inp = input().lower() print(&quot;Input:&quot;, inp) for i in inp: for n in words: if i == n[0]: print (n) . Input: gay golf alfa yankee . 2D Iteration . 2D Arrays . A 2D array is simply just a list of lists. The example below is technically correct but... . keypad = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [&quot; &quot;, 0, &quot; &quot;]] . Conventially 2D arrays are written like below. This is because 2D arrays are meant to be read in 2 dimensions (hence the name). Writing them like below makes them easier to visualize and understand. . keypad = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [&quot; &quot;, 0, &quot; &quot;]] . Printing a 2D Array . We already know that we can&#39;t just print the matrix by calling it. We need to iterate through it to print it. . def print_matrix1(matrix): for i in range(len(matrix)): # outer for loop. This runs on i which represents the row. range(len(matrix)) is in order to iterate through the length of the matrix for j in range(len(matrix[i])): # inner for loop. This runs on the length of the i&#39;th row in the matrix (j changes for each row with a different length) print(matrix[i][j], end=&quot; &quot;) # [i][j] is the 2D location of that value in the matrix, kinda like a coordinate pair. [i] iterates to the specific row and [j] iterates to the specific value in the row. end=&quot; &quot; changes the end value to space, not a new line. print() # prints extra line. this is in the outer loop, not the inner loop, because it only wants to print a new line for each row . print(&quot;Raw matrix (list of lists): &quot;) print(keypad) print(&quot;Matrix printed using nested for loop iteration:&quot;) print_matrix1(keypad) print() . Raw matrix (list of lists): [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [&#39; &#39;, 0, &#39; &#39;]] Matrix printed using nested for loop iteration: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 . def print_matrix2(matrix): for row in matrix: # Iterates through each &quot;row&quot; of matrix. Row is a dummy variable, it could technically be anything. It iterates through each value of matrix and each value is it&#39;s own list. in this syntax the list is stored in &quot;row&quot;. for col in row: # Iterates through each value in row. Again col, column, is a dummy variable. Each value in row is stored in col. print(col, end=&quot; &quot;) # Same as 1 print() # Same as 1 print_matrix2(keypad) . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 . More Functions . Try to find another way to print the matrix. Only complete one of the two (unless you&#39;d like to do both). Below is a hint . fruit = [&quot;apples&quot;, &quot;bananas&quot;, &quot;grapes&quot;] veggies = [&quot;carrots&quot;, &quot;potatoes&quot;, &quot;onions&quot;] meats = [&quot;chicken&quot;, &quot;beef&quot;, &quot;pork&quot;] both = [fruit, veggies, meats] print(both) . [[&#39;apples&#39;, &#39;bananas&#39;, &#39;grapes&#39;], [&#39;carrots&#39;, &#39;potatoes&#39;, &#39;onions&#39;], [&#39;chicken&#39;, &#39;beef&#39;, &#39;pork&#39;]] . def print_matrix3(matrix): for row in matrix: # Iterates through each &quot;row&quot; of matrix. Row is a dummy variable, it could technically be anything. It iterates through each value of matrix and each value is it&#39;s own list. in this syntax the list is stored in &quot;row&quot;. for col in row: # Iterates through each value in row. Again col, column, is a dummy variable. Each value in row is stored in col. print(col, end=&quot; &quot;) # Same as 1 print() # Same as 1 print_matrix3(both) . apples bananas grapes carrots potatoes onions chicken beef pork . keyboard = [[&quot;`&quot;, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0, &quot;-&quot;, &quot;=&quot;], [&quot;Q&quot;, &quot;W&quot;, &quot;E&quot;, &quot;R&quot;, &quot;T&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;, &quot;U&quot;, &quot;I&quot;, &quot;O&quot;, &quot;P&quot;, &quot;[&quot;, &quot;]&quot;], [&quot;A&quot;, &quot;S&quot;, &quot;D&quot;, &quot;F&quot;, &quot;G&quot;, &quot;H&quot;, &quot;J&quot;, &quot;K&quot;, &quot;L&quot;, &quot;;&quot;, &quot;&#39;&quot;], [&quot;Z&quot;, &quot;X&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, &quot;V&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;N&quot;, &quot;M&quot;, &quot;,&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, &quot;/&quot;]] print (keyboard) . [[&#39;`&#39;, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0, &#39;-&#39;, &#39;=&#39;], [&#39;Q&#39;, &#39;W&#39;, &#39;E&#39;, &#39;R&#39;, &#39;T&#39;, &#39;Y&#39;, &#39;U&#39;, &#39;I&#39;, &#39;O&#39;, &#39;P&#39;, &#39;[&#39;, &#39;]&#39;], [&#39;A&#39;, &#39;S&#39;, &#39;D&#39;, &#39;F&#39;, &#39;G&#39;, &#39;H&#39;, &#39;J&#39;, &#39;K&#39;, &#39;L&#39;, &#39;;&#39;, &#34;&#39;&#34;], [&#39;Z&#39;, &#39;X&#39;, &#39;C&#39;, &#39;V&#39;, &#39;B&#39;, &#39;N&#39;, &#39;M&#39;, &#39;,&#39;, &#39;.&#39;, &#39;/&#39;]] . Print what month you were born and how old you are by iterating through the keyboard (don&#39;t just write a string). . Challenge . Change all of the letters that you DIDN&#39;T print above to spaces, &quot; &quot;, and then print the full keyboard. (the things you did print should remain in the same spot) . Alternative Challenge: If you would prefer, animate it using some form of delay so it flashes one of your letters at a time on the board in order and repeats. (this one may be slightly more intuitive) . DO NOT HARD CODE THIS. Don&#39;t make it harder on yourself, iterate through, make it abstract so it can be used dynamically. You should be able to input any string and your code should work. . . 1 6 R A H C M . If you get stuck you can just make a picture with an array and print it (I will grade based on how good it looks) . I do expect an attempt so write some code to show you tried the challenge. .",

What is a boolean? . A data type with two possible values: true or false | . Boolean and Binary . So similar yet so different. . Boolean math and binary notation both use the same two ciphers: 1 and 0. | However, please note that Boolean quantities are restricted to a singlular bit (can only be either 1, or 0) | On the otherhand, binary numbers may be composed of many bits adding up in place-weighted form to any finite value, or size | . Must Knows . A Boolean value is either TRUE or FALSE | The AP Exam will provide you with a reference sheet with the operators listed. | . Relational Operators in action . How could you use operators to determine if the average of 5 grades is greater than 80? | . With the grades below, use a boolean expression to determine if the average grade is above an 80 and print the result (True or False) | Try it in as few steps as possible! | Be creative! There are obviously TONS of different practical solutions | . grade1 = 90 grade2 = 65 grade3 = 60 grade4 = 75 grade5 = 95 grade6 = grade1 + grade2 + grade3 + grade4 + grade5 grade7 = grade6 / 5 print (&quot;Average Grade:&quot;, grade7) if grade7 &gt; 80: print (&quot;True&quot;) else: print (&quot;False&quot;) . Average Grade: 77.0 False . The versatility of relational operators: . print(&quot;100 == 100:&quot;,100==100) print(&quot;Hello == Adios:&quot;,&quot;greeting&quot;==&quot;farewell&quot;) print(&quot;Hello != Adios:&quot;,&quot;greeting&quot;!=&quot;farewell&quot;) print(&quot;Hello == Hola:&quot;,&quot;greeting&quot;==&quot;greeting&quot;) print(&quot;5&gt;=4:&quot;, 5&gt;=4) print (&#39;&#39;) # Notice that relational operators can even work on lists! # For lists, the relational operator compares each respective component until an answer is derived print(&quot;[&#39;a&#39;,&#39;b&#39;,&#39;c&#39;] &gt; [&#39;x&#39;,&#39;y&#39;,&#39;z&#39;]:&quot;, [&#39;a&#39;,&#39;b&#39;,&#39;c&#39;] &gt; [&#39;x&#39;,&#39;y&#39;,&#39;z&#39;]) print(&quot;[1,2,3,5] &gt; [1,2,3,4]:&quot;, [1,2,3,5] &gt; [1,2,3,4]) print(&quot;[1,2,3,5] &lt; [1,2,3,4]:&quot;, [1,2,3,5] &lt; [1,2,3,4]) print(&quot;[1,2,3,5] == [1,2,3,4]:&quot;, [1,2,3,5] == [1,2,3,4]) . 100 == 100: True Hello == Adios: False Hello != Adios: True Hello == Hola: True 5&gt;=4: True [&#39;a&#39;,&#39;b&#39;,&#39;c&#39;] &gt; [&#39;x&#39;,&#39;y&#39;,&#39;z&#39;]: False [1,2,3,5] &gt; [1,2,3,4]: True [1,2,3,5] &lt; [1,2,3,4]: False [1,2,3,5] == [1,2,3,4]: False . Logical Operators! . These types of operators don&#39;t necessarily deal with equivalent/non-equivalent values, but they rather work on operands to produce a singular boolean result . AND : returns TRUE if the operands around it are TRUE | OR : returns TRUE if at least one operand is TRUE | NOT : returns TRUE if the following boolean is FALSE | . Turn the following arithmetic phrases into either True or False statements as indicated USING LOGICAL OPERATORS . print(&quot;1 &gt; 2 or 5 &lt; 12:&quot;, 1 &gt; 2 or 5 &lt; 12) # Output TRUE using OR ^ # Output FALSE using NOT print(&quot;24 &gt; 8:&quot;, not 24 &gt; 8) # Output FALSE using AND print(&quot;10 &gt; 20:&quot;, 10 &gt; 20 and 20 &lt; 10) . 1 &gt; 2 or 5 &lt; 12: True 24 &gt; 8: False 10 &gt; 20: False . Lesson Overview: 3.6 - Conditionals . Focusing on Selection . Selection: uses a condition that evaluates to true or false . Selection determines which part of an algorithm are executed based on a condition being true or false . Algorithm is a finite set of instructions that accomplish a specific task . Conditional Statements . Also known as &quot;if statements&quot; . Can be seen as if statements or if blocks . Can also be seen as if else statements or if else-blocks . x = 20 y = 10 if x &gt; y: print(&quot;x is greater than y&quot;) . x is greater than y . x = 0 y = 10 if x &gt; y: print(&quot;x is greater than y&quot;) else: print(&quot;x is not greater than y&quot;) . x is not greater than y . Participation . -Calculate the total sum of two numbers, if it is equal to 200, print 200, if otherwise, print the sum. . num1 = 100 num2 = 200 sum = num1 + num2 if sum == 200: print(&quot;200&quot;) else: print(sum) . 300 . Lesson Overview - 3.7 Nested Conditionals . Nested conditional statements consist of conditional statements within other conditional statements | Utilizes &quot;if else&quot; statements within &quot;if else&quot; statements | .

Looks great but lets see if we can cut down on sugar, we don&#39;t want diabetes! . Writing Nested Code Activity . Write a program that fits these conditions using nested conditionals: If a person has at least 8 hours, they are experienced | If a person is experienced their salary is 90k, if they have ten hours or above their salary 150k | If a person is inexperienced their salary is always 50k | print the salary of the person at the end and whether they are experienced or not | . | hours = 9 if (hours &gt;= 8) { if (hours &gt;= 10) { console.log(&quot;Congrats, you are experienced!&quot;) salary = 150000 } else { console.log(&quot;Congrats, you are experienced!&quot;) salary = 90000 } } else { console.log(&quot;You suck, you are unexperienced!&quot;) salary = 50000 } console.log(&quot;Salary =&quot;,salary, &quot;dollars&quot;); . Congrats, you are experienced! Salary = 90000 dollars . Hacks Assignments: . Conditionals: . Write a program that fits these conditions using nested conditionals: If the product is expired, print &quot;this product is no good&quot; | If the cost is above 50 dollars, and the product isn&#39;t expired, print &quot;this product is too expensive&quot; | If the cost is 25 dollars but under 50, and the product isn&#39;t expired, print &quot;this is a regular product&quot; | If the cost is under 25 dollars, print &quot;this is a cheap product&quot; | . | . expired = false cost = 75 if (expired == false) { if (cost &gt; 50) { console.log(&quot;This product is too expensive!&quot;) } else { if (cost &lt; 25) { console.log(&quot;This is a cheap product!&quot;) } else { console.log(&quot;This is a regular product!&quot;) } } } else { console.log(&quot;this product is no good!&quot;) } .

Sequencing: Algorithms do tasks in the order of specification. | . Selection: Helps choose two different outcomes based off a decision. | . Iteration: If a condition is true, then the code can repeat. | . Algorithms Can Be Represented in Two Ways . Flowcharts: Use shapes and arrows to represent the steps of an algorithm. | . . Pseudocode: A blend of human language and coding format. | Hacks: Jamboard Flowchart . Click on this link for a group activity . . . Arithmetic Operations . Arithmetic operations exist in most programming languages. . Basic Operations . Subtraction: . Represented by “-&quot; | . num1 = 2 - 1 . Addition: . Represented by &quot;+&quot; | . num1 = 2 + 1 . Multiplication: . Represented by “*” | . num1 = 2 * 1 . Division: . Represented by “/” | . num1 = 2 / 1 . Getting the Remainder: . Represented by “MOD” (% in python) | . num1 = 5 % 2 . Different Uses . Items can be numbers or variables. . Examples: . num1 = 10 num2 = num1 - 25 num3 = 100 * num1 num4 = num1 / num2 num5 = 9 % num4 . Order of Operations . Arithmetic operations in programming are performed in the same order as operations in mathematics: . Operations in parentheses should be done first. . | Division and multiplication should be done before addition and subtraction. . | Modulus works similar to multiplication and division. . | . Example: Evaluate num1 . num1 = 9 % 2 * ( 8 - 2 ) + 8 / ( 6 - 4 ) print(num1) . 10.0 . . . Variables . Different Ways Values are Stored in Variables . Numerical value stored in a variable . | Value of another variable stored in a variable . | Result of an operation stored in a variable . | Result of a procedure call stored in a variable . | score = 0 # 1 score = newScore # 2 score = newScore + 2 # 3 avgScore = allscores(20, 60, 80) # 4 . Sequencing is Important! . Changing the order of the steps changes the overall outcome, since every time the value assigned to a variable is changed, it overrides the last value which was assigned to the same variable. That is why it is important to track the value of variables, especially in code where the value is constantly changing. . num1 = 2 num2 = 4 num3 = 6 num1 = num2 + num3 # num1 is now 4 + 6, which is 10 num2 = num1 + num3 # num2 is now (the new num1) 10 + 6, which is 16 # output: num1 = 10, num2 = 16, num3 = 6 . VS . num1 = 2 num2 = 4 num3 = 6 num2 = num1 + num3 #num2 is now 8 num1 = num2 + num3 # num1 is now 14 # output: num1 = 14, num2 = 8, num3 = 6 . Tracking Variables . Tracking variables is a common question found on AP exams and is an important thing to keep in mind when writing any code. If the value of your variables changes a lot, not accounting for these changes can result in an unwanted outcome. . var1 = 9 var2 = 7 var3 = 2 #var = var1 + 5 #var2 = var1 - var3 #var1 = var2 #var3 = (var1 + var2) / 2 #var2 = 6 print(var1) print(var2) print(var3) .

A string is a collection of characters. What is a character as character can be anything from numbers, letters, spaces, special symbols, etc. . Certain procedures may be used with strings and they vary from programming language to language Python examples . len() to find the length of a string . lower() to convert to lowercase . etc. Pseudocode examples . len() returns the length of a string . concat() returns a string made up of the concatenated strings ex. concat(&quot;string1&quot;, &quot;string2&quot;) would return string1string2 . substring() returns the characters from the string beginning at the at the first position to the last so an example of this would be substring (&quot;abcdefghijk&quot;, 2, 5) would print bcde (pseudocode starts at 1) . String Concatenation . What is string concatenation? . String concatenation is combining 2 or more strings to make a new strings in order to create a new string . concat() in pseudocode and varys from language to language can be used to combine to strings such as concat(&quot;cookie&quot;,&quot;monster&quot;) returns cookiemonster . Substrings . What is a substring? . A substring is a part of and already existing string. . In pseudocode substring() method is used for instance for concat(&quot;Mr.Mortenson is very handsome&quot; 1, 2) the system would return Mr (remember that pseudocode starts at 1) . Hacks . Find the result of the following problems. Then convert the pseudocode to working python code using your knowledge of python string operators. . Problem 1 . Noun = &quot;Mr.Mortenson&quot; Adjective = &quot;handsome&quot; Adjective2 = &quot;Very&quot; Verb = &quot;is&quot; abrev = subtring(Noun, 1, 7) yoda = concat(Adjective2, &quot; &quot;, Adjective, &quot; &quot;, abrev, &quot; &quot;,Verb, &quot;.&quot;) display[yoda] .

Method used in coding to represent data in a useful form, by taking away aspects of data that aren&#39;t being used in the situation | Variables and lists are primary tools in data abstraction | Provides a separation between the abstract properties of a data type and the concrete details of its representation | . Why do we Use Data Abstraction? Managing the Complexity of a Program . Data abstractions help manage complexity in programs by giving a collection of data a name without referencing the specific details of the representation | Developing a data abstraction to use in a program can result in a program that is easier to develop and maintain | . Lists: Amazing for Data Abstractions . What are Lists? . Allow for data abstraction | Bundle variables together | Store multiple elements | Allows multiple related items to be treated as a single value | Give one name to a set of memory cells | Can keep adding elements to it as needed | Can store elements as a single variable by using a list | . 3 Types of List Operations: . Assigning values to a list at certain indices | Creating an empty list and assigning it to a variable | Assigning a copy of one list to another list (setting one list equal to another list) | .

            "content": "Evidence of Final Taken: . I got a 48 out of 50 on the final, which was a MUCH higher score than I expected to get. I will be going over the questions that I got wrong and attempt corrections, as well as going over questions that I guessed and still don&#39;t understand. . . Strengths and Weaknesses: . Strengths: . Strong knowledge of Collaboration, the Internet, and other mostly conceptual questions | Decent arithmetic and logic skills to solve many code segments | . Weaknesses: . Need more practice and understanding of both complex lists and binary | Take more time reading the code segments to fully understand the algorithms at play | . Corrections for Incorrect Questions: . Question 1: Behavior of code that multiplies inside a loop . I got this question wrong because I incorrectly assumed that the code segment used a double multiplication algorithm. In reality the repeat function combined with the multiplication statement means that an exponent should be used in the formula. 2 (5 5 5) = 2 (5^3) . Question 35: Set maxPS based on time . I got this question wrong because I incorrectly chose C as one of the options, which assigns maxPS the value 50 when time &gt; 120 and assigns maxPS the value 30 otherwise. This does not set the maxPS based on time. The A option has the correct code segment that sets maxPS to 50, then uses the IF statement to set maxPS to 30 when time &gt; 120. . Corrections for Misunderstood Questions: . There are still questions that I didn&#39;t understand, but still answered correctly. I went back to these questions to strengthen my learning further. . Question 13: Test cases for allPositive in a list . I got this question right because I simply assumed that positive integer list errors are usually caused by a negative one. I didn&#39;t know the full reasoning behind my answer, and I now understand that the procedure returns true when it should return false because the list does not contain only positive values. . Question 22: Decimal value not equal to given binary values . I got this question right by just guessing, and I don&#39;t have the fullest grasp of binary arithmetic yet. Studying the question again, I now understand that in the most basic form of binary, Binary 0011 is equivalent to 2^1+2^0, or decimal 3. Binary 0110 is equivalent to 2^2+2^1, or decimal 6. Binary 1111 is equivalent to 2^3+2^2+2^1+2^0, or decimal 15. This is why Decimal 9 is the correct answer. . Question 42: Value of sum after IF ELSE IF . I got this question right by using incorrect math. I assumed that num3 was ignored and replaced with num2, but I didn&#39;t fully understand the other argument shown. Since num2 ≥ num3 evaluates to true, the body of the second IF block is executed and num1 is assigned the value 8. Lastly, sum is assigned the value of 8 + 4 + 4, or 16. . Question 45: Values of counts after traversing theList . I got this question right by just guessing, and I didn&#39;t really process how theList values communicated with the If/Else statemment in this code segment. I realized that before addition is preformed, the code segment first iterates through each element in the list, incrementing count1 for each positive value and incrementing count2 otherwise. The list only contains two positive values, so count1 is 2 and count2 is 3. .",

Backend Interface for Web API (Control) . An application programming interface (API) is the medium by which different systems of software interact. In our applications we have two big systems:1. Python Backend that stores data beyond a single Web page2. GH Pages/Fastpages Frontend that is responsible for presenting data . To communicate data between Frontend and Backend, this section Backend code provides and interface to the Frontend using a Web Service Endpoint. Examples of endpoints are listed below and can be typed within a browser, which will return JSON data: . https://flask.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/api/jokes | https://flask.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/api/jokes/2 | https://flask.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/api/jokes/random | . As you can see, these Endpoints return JSON. They are NOT that readable by normal humans. However, they are very effective in passing requested data across the Internet. The Frontend code is responsible for formatting and presenting and interface that allows the typical computer user to interact with this data. . The next cell of code is Creating Endpoints that return JSON. This allows developers in the Frontend to interact with Backend data. API is a contract between the Frontend and Backend on how to share data. . FYI, there is NO output from this section . . from flask import Blueprint, jsonify # jsonify creates an endpoint response object from flask_restful import Api, Resource # used for REST API building import requests # used for testing import random # Blueprints allow this code to be procedurally abstracted from main.py, meaning code is not all in one place app_api = Blueprint(&#39;api&#39;, __name__, url_prefix=&#39;/api/jokes&#39;) # endpoint prefix avoid redundantly typing /api/jokes over and over # API generator https://flask-restful.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#id1 api = Api(app_api) class JokesAPI: # not implemented, this would be where we would allow creation of a new Joke class _Create(Resource): def post(self, joke): pass # getJokes() class _Read(Resource): def get(self): return jsonify(getJokes()) # getJoke(id) class _ReadID(Resource): def get(self, id): return jsonify(getJoke(id)) # getRandomJoke() class _ReadRandom(Resource): def get(self): return jsonify(getRandomJoke()) # getRandomJoke() class _ReadCount(Resource): def get(self): count = countJokes() countMsg = {&#39;count&#39;: count} return jsonify(countMsg) # put method: addJokeHaHa class _UpdateLike(Resource): def put(self, id): addJokeHaHa(id) return jsonify(getJoke(id)) # put method: addJokeBooHoo class _UpdateJeer(Resource): def put(self, id): addJokeBooHoo(id) return jsonify(getJoke(id)) # building RESTapi interfaces, these routes are added to Web Server http://&lt;server&lt;/api/jokes api.add_resource(_Create, &#39;/create/&lt;string:joke&gt;&#39;) api.add_resource(_Read, &#39;/&#39;) # default, which returns all jokes api.add_resource(_ReadID, &#39;/&lt;int:id&gt;&#39;) api.add_resource(_ReadRandom, &#39;/random&#39;) api.add_resource(_ReadCount, &#39;/count&#39;) api.add_resource(_UpdateLike, &#39;/like/&lt;int:id&gt;/&#39;) api.add_resource(_UpdateJeer, &#39;/jeer/&lt;int:id&gt;/&#39;) . Frontend (View Simulation) and Hacks . This python codes tests endpoints on a server. This can be handy for development and testing when making modifications to the Jokes Web APIs.

You could input the name of your favorite team, and the program will redirect the user to a displayed page of their team&#39;s statistics, images, and most valuable players. . College Board Criteria . 1. Program Purpose and Function . The purpose has already been defined: to create a search engine for data display of basketball teams in the NBA. | Our members will understand the individual code segments that make up the frontend and backend, working together to clear any issues and creating a working program. | Both input and output should be intuitive to the group and the users. | . 2. Data Abstraction . We will be demonstrating how data is stored in a list or dictionary of each of the basketball teams in the NBA. Possible use of an API can help store and display data easier. Output will be displayed in a separate page through a table. | Example: Celtics = [“1st NBA Team Formed”, “17 NBA Titles”, “Stadium: TD Garden”] | . 3. Managing Complexity . Because we are using lists, dictionaries, and tables to display team statistics, it is not necessary to write if/else statements for each data point, though a loop command or whileloop command may help for iteration when storing data. | Multiple functions may have to be written for individual teams, or an API could be used to fetch data if possible. | . 4. Procedural Abstraction . An algorithm will be used to detect an incorrect user input, i.e. a spelling error in the search feature. | For example, def team_input if Team = TeamList print(“Team Name, Titles Won, Stadium”) else print(“Please input team”) | . 5. Algorithm Implementation . The algorithm will be based on their choice of NBA team. Different points of data will be chosen based on the users input, and the option to include other assets like fun facts and images on top of the iterated data will need mre backend development. | . 6. Testing . Testing will be performed frequently, and the final product will be completed with a brief explanation and video. | .",

This example passes the previously defined variable &quot;msg&quot; to the newly defined &quot;function logIt(output)&quot;. . There are two steps in the code, the definition of the function and the call to the function. &quot;function logIt(output) {}&quot; and everything between curly braces is the definitions of the function. | &quot;logIt(msg)&quot; is the call to the function, this actually activates the function.

Reuse of logIT Hello, Students! 2022 . Dynamic or Loosely typed language (string, number) . JavaScript is a loosely typed language, meaning you don&#39;t have to specify what type of information will be stored in a variable in advance. The variable type is determined at runtime. This is similar to Python and most interpretive languages. Java which is a compiled language is strongly typed, thus you will see string, integer, double, and object in the source code. In JavaScript, the &quot;typeof&quot; keyword returns the type. . function logItType(output) { console.log(typeof output, &quot;;&quot;, output); } console.log(&quot;Strings, integers, and arrays&quot;) logItType(&quot;AP Computer Science Principles&quot;); // String logItType(20 / 2); // Arithmetic logItType([&quot;Jeffrey&quot;, &quot;Luke&quot;, &quot;Ethan&quot;, &quot;James&quot;]); // Object is generic for this Array, which similar to Python List .

Build a Person Function/Class object and JSON . JavaScript functions have special properties and syntax is shown in many ways. In fact, a Class in JavaScript is a special function. Jupyter Notebooks seems to be more friendly to &quot;function&quot; definitions versus &quot;Class&quot;, thus this lesson uses &quot;function&quot; and &quot;prototype&quot; versus &quot;Class&quot;. . Definition of function allows for a collection of data, the &quot;function Person&quot; allows programmer to retain name, github id, and class of designation. | Definition of a prototype allow for the definition of a method associated with the function , the &quot;Person.prototype.toJSON&quot; allows the collection of data to be expressed in a json/string versus JavaScript object. | Instance of a function, the &quot;var teacher = new Person(&quot;Mr M&quot;, &quot;jm1021&quot;, 1977)&quot; line makes a variable &quot;teacher&quot; which is an object representation of &quot;function Person&quot;. | . // define a function to hold data for a Person function Person(name, ghID, classOf) { this.name = name; this.ghID = ghID; this.classOf = classOf; this.role = &quot;&quot;; } // define a setter for role in Person data Person.prototype.setRole = function(role) { this.role = role; } // define a JSON conversion &quot;method&quot; associated with Person Person.prototype.toJSON = function() { const obj = {name: this.name, ghID: this.ghID, classOf: this.classOf, role: this.role}; const json = JSON.stringify(obj); return json; } // make a new Person and assign to variable teacher var teacher = new Person(&quot;Mr Mortensen&quot;, &quot;jm1021&quot;, 1977); teacher.setRole(&quot;Teacher&quot;); // output of Object and JSON/string associated with Teacher logItType(teacher); // object type is easy to work with in JavaScript logItType(teacher.toJSON()); // json/string is useful when passing data on internet . object ; Person { name: &#39;Mr Mortensen&#39;, ghID: &#39;jm1021&#39;, classOf: 1977, role: &#39;Teacher&#39; } string ; {&#34;name&#34;:&#34;Mr Mortensen&#34;,&#34;ghID&#34;:&#34;jm1021&#34;,&#34;classOf&#34;:1977,&#34;role&#34;:&#34;Teacher&#34;} .

I decided on a topic of Mountains and Mountain Ranges and wrote the following three questions with answer choices: . What is the tallest mountain in the World? Answer Choices: Mt. Everest, Mt. K2, Mt. Fiji, Mt. Kilimanjaro. . How many main mountain ranges exist in America? Answer Choices: One, Two, Three, Four . What is the World Record altitude for a human mountaineer? Answer Choices: 29,029 Feet, 26,545 Feet, 28,750 Feet, 24,075 Feet . I then got to designing the actual quiz on AppLab. Here&#39;s an image of my initial Javascript code, where I used the most basic functions: . . Link to my Project! . Mountains Quiz . Successes and Failures . The whole process went relatively smoothly, with the code and design segments being very straightforward to use. I like the Code.org software and how I can seamlessly switch between blocks and actual code to learn Javascript better. . Some setbacks did happen during the process, I initially had some difficulty finding the right code to make up the quiz functions, but eventually I found my solutions with the &quot;switch screen&quot; function. Time management was also an issue, but I managed to finish the quiz and planning by the due date. .",

Computer science stretches far beyond basic programming and leads to many avenues of exploration, including problem-solving, functions and algorithms, the complexity of web development, and building logical thinking backgrounds towards other degrees. It is an all-purpose technical background to develop your skills. . When the alumni were talking about their greatest challenges in computer science, I could relate to many of their insecurities with errors being major roadblocks that you have to work through. On top of this, I would definitely agree that those who are “good” at computer science think that they are better than others. Many aspects of computer science in general are much more enjoyable if you focus on your own path and keep maintaining motivation. There is a lot of temptation to copy or plagiarize someone else’s work, and you need to change your mindset to overcome this. . Finally, I learned about the further applications of computer science, specifically in mechanical engineering, which is conveniently also my major of choice. I learned that computer science could be used to write scripts that can automate tasks in projects. Even CAD projects and basic Jupyter notebooks have applicable code to make your life easier. . I gained so much insight from this panel, and I am eager to learn even more about computer science in the near future. .",

With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. . A #hide_input comment at the top of any code cell will only hide the input of that cell. . The comment #hide_input was used to hide the code that produced this. . put a #collapse-hide flag at the top of any cell if you want to hide that cell by default, but give the reader the option to show it: . import pandas as pd import altair as alt . . put a #collapse-show flag at the top of any cell if you want to show that cell by default, but give the reader the option to hide it: . cars = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/cars.json&#39; movies = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/movies.json&#39; sp500 = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/sp500.csv&#39; stocks = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/stocks.csv&#39; flights = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/flights-5k.json&#39; . . place a #collapse-output flag at the top of any cell if you want to put the output under a collapsable element that is closed by default, but give the reader the option to open it: . print(&#39;The comment #collapse-output was used to collapse the output of this cell by default but you can expand it.&#39;) . The comment #collapse-output was used to collapse the output of this cell by default but you can expand it. . . Interactive Charts With Altair . Charts made with Altair remain interactive. Example charts taken from this repo, specifically this notebook. . Example 1: DropDown . # use specific hard-wired values as the initial selected values selection = alt.selection_single( name=&#39;Select&#39;, fields=[&#39;Major_Genre&#39;, &#39;MPAA_Rating&#39;], init={&#39;Major_Genre&#39;: &#39;Drama&#39;, &#39;MPAA_Rating&#39;: &#39;R&#39;}, bind={&#39;Major_Genre&#39;: alt.binding_select(options=genres), &#39;MPAA_Rating&#39;: alt.binding_radio(options=mpaa)} ) # scatter plot, modify opacity based on selection alt.Chart(df).mark_circle().add_selection( selection ).encode( x=&#39;Rotten_Tomatoes_Rating:Q&#39;, y=&#39;IMDB_Rating:Q&#39;, tooltip=&#39;Title:N&#39;, opacity=alt.condition(selection, alt.value(0.75), alt.value(0.05)) ) . Example 2: Tooltips . alt.Chart(df).mark_circle().add_selection( alt.selection_interval(bind=&#39;scales&#39;, encodings=[&#39;x&#39;]) ).encode( alt.X(&#39;Rotten_Tomatoes_Rating&#39;, type=&#39;quantitative&#39;), alt.Y(&#39;IMDB_Rating&#39;, type=&#39;quantitative&#39;, axis=alt.Axis(minExtent=30)), # y=alt.Y(&#39;IMDB_Rating:Q&#39;, ), # use min extent to stabilize axis title placement tooltip=[&#39;Title:N&#39;, &#39;Release_Date:N&#39;, &#39;IMDB_Rating:Q&#39;, &#39;Rotten_Tomatoes_Rating:Q&#39;] ).properties( width=500, height=400 ) . Example 3: More Tooltips . label = alt.selection_single( encodings=[&#39;x&#39;], # limit selection to x-axis value on=&#39;mouseover&#39;, # select on mouseover events nearest=True, # select data point nearest the cursor empty=&#39;none&#39; # empty selection includes no data points ) # define our base line chart of stock prices base = alt.Chart().mark_line().encode( alt.X(&#39;date:T&#39;), alt.Y(&#39;price:Q&#39;, scale=alt.Scale(type=&#39;log&#39;)), alt.Color(&#39;symbol:N&#39;) ) alt.layer( base, # base line chart # add a rule mark to serve as a guide line alt.Chart().mark_rule(color=&#39;#aaa&#39;).encode( x=&#39;date:T&#39; ).transform_filter(label), # add circle marks for selected time points, hide unselected points base.mark_circle().encode( opacity=alt.condition(label, alt.value(1), alt.value(0)) ).add_selection(label), # add white stroked text to provide a legible background for labels base.mark_text(align=&#39;left&#39;, dx=5, dy=-5, stroke=&#39;white&#39;, strokeWidth=2).encode( text=&#39;price:Q&#39; ).transform_filter(label), # add text labels for stock prices base.mark_text(align=&#39;left&#39;, dx=5, dy=-5).encode( text=&#39;price:Q&#39; ).transform_filter(label), data=stocks ).properties( width=500, height=400 ) . Data Tables . You can display tables per the usual way in your blog: . df[[&#39;Title&#39;, &#39;Worldwide_Gross&#39;, &#39;Production_Budget&#39;, &#39;Distributor&#39;, &#39;MPAA_Rating&#39;, &#39;IMDB_Rating&#39;, &#39;Rotten_Tomatoes_Rating&#39;]].head() .

This guide provides more detail about this syntax, which looks like this: . For example, here is a footnote {% fn 1 %}. And another {% fn 2 %} {{ &#39;This is the footnote.&#39; | fndetail: 1 }} {{ &#39;This is the other footnote. You can even have a [link](www.github.com)!&#39; | fndetail: 2 }} .

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | . And a numbered list: . item 1 | item 2 | Boxes and stuff . This is a quotation . . You can include alert boxes …and… . . You can include info boxes Images . . Code .

While it’s possible to solve all of these on your own, a much better way of tackling AP CSP difficulties is through Collaboration, Communication, Critical Thinking, and Creativity. Most importantly, viewing mistakes as learning opportunities and asking questions improves the learning experience for everyone. . When talking about focus, I think it’s important to recognize that Computer Science is very intertwined. We need to look at the bigger picture of what we are doing instead of the actual code itself. With the help of stand-up meetings, issue tickets, and live reviews, there are many opportunities for others to comment on our work and to stay accountable. .",
