<p>Del Norte holds an event called Night at the Museum at the end of each trimester. This event provides an opportunity for students in project-based classes, including studio art, photography, ceramics, computer science, and other unique courses, to exhibit their projects. It allows them to display the hard work they have put in over the previous few months and to view the work of others, gaining inspiration and insight into different perspectives on art and creative thinking.</p>

<p>For myself and my team, this was a great opportunity to showcase our current CPT project development and features. While our groups was created relatively late and therefore had a set amount of time to prepare for this NATM, we worked very hard to deliver tangibles and meet deadlines. This resulted in the development of all features outlined in our Create Performance Task, as well as a functional FullStack application complete with frontend and backend websites.</p>

<p>During the N@TM event, I was able to view the Breadbops, whose project I had been observing and providing feedback on for the last few weeks. I was eager to see their final product, especially when I saw their sleek home screen, with a fully functioning login system and great data abstraction. This inspired me to consider developing a list function for my developing feature. As I explored their project further, I discovered several features, including a search bar with attributes, a “reserve” function that placed specific cars in one’s inventory, an account creation/deletion option, and a review section for users to provide feedback about their website experience.</p>

<p>Out of all the features, I enjoyed playing around with the “reserve” the most. I was able to view various labeled car listings on the website, making it an extremely useful tool for browsing and shopping. Overall, the Breadbops group did an excellent job of presenting their project, and I look forward to seeing a more polished and functional version of the product in the future, as their unique ideas have the potential to be incredibly useful to many people.</p>

<h2 id="recipies">

<p>During this team’s presentation, I was extremely impressed with how well each member of the group understood both the front-end and back-end components of the project, as well as how each feature functioned seamlessly together. The project, called ReciPies, was developed to be a simple recipe uploader and finder, as the group noticed that there was no great website that completed all of their current features. Using Java, Python, and JavaScript, and with a great deal of customization of their front-end using HTML/CSS, the group created a functional login/signup page that allows users to create their own accounts and recipies or access existing ones.</p>

<p>At the N@TM event, I tested the project by creating my own account and checking a recipe, and the group demonstrated how their site handles seamlessly compared to other websites. I found the project to be engaging, and appreciated the opportunity to test the project myself, which greatly increased my interest in it.</p>

<p>Overall, this was by far my favorite Night at The Museum event, where I was not only able to present my own features confidently but also saw dozens of interesting and thought-provoking ideas from others. The oppotunities and flexibility of the Create Performance Task resulted in some truly great projects, and combined with the Full Stack process of web applications I was able to take away more from this evening than others.</p>
